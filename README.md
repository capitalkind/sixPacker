Six Packer is a MEAN stack application using the Google Maps API. Users sign up and log in using token based authentication. Once logged in, the map geolocates to the user's position and they can see all the six packs in their vicinity, as well as add new six packs for all users to see. After the user adds a new six pack it instantly renders on the map. The user can also click on "Show posts" to view all the six packs that they themselves have submitted, and are able to delete them should they so choose.
